\title{Creates a vector of indicators (0 and 1) for sensitivity/DSA analysis}
\usage{
create_indicators(sens, n_sensitivity, elem, n_elem_before = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{sens}{current analysis iterator}

\item{n_sensitivity}{total number of analyses to be run}

\item{elem}{vector of 0s and 1s of elements to iterate through (1 = parameter is to be included in scenario/DSA)}

\item{n_elem_before}{Sum of 1s (# of parameters to be included in scenario/DSA) that go before elem}
}
\value{
Numeric vector composed of 0 and 1, where value 1 will be used by \code{pick_val_v} to pick the corresponding index in its \code{sens} argument
}
\description{
Creates a vector of indicators (0 and 1) for sensitivity/DSA analysis
}
\details{
n_elem_before is to be used when several indicators want to be used (e.g., for patient level and common level inputs) while facilitating readibility of the code
}
\examples{
create_indicators(10,20,c(1,1,1,1))
create_indicators(7,20,c(1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1),2)
}
