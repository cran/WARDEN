\title{Draw from a conditional Gompertz distribution (lower bound only)}
\usage{

\arguments{
\item{n}{The number of observations to be drawn}

\item{shape}{The shape parameter of the Gompertz distribution, defined as in the coef() output on a flexsurvreg object}

\item{rate}{The rate parameter of the Gompertz distribution, defined as in the coef() output on a flexsurvreg object}

\item{lower_bound}{The lower bound of the conditional distribution}

\item{seed}{An integer which will be used to set the seed for this draw.}
}
\value{
Estimate(s) from the conditional Gompertz distribution based on given parameters
