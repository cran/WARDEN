\title{Draw from a dirichlet distribution based on mean transition probabilities and standard errors}
\usage{
rdirichlet_prob(n = 1, alpha, se, seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Number of draws (must be >= 1). If n>1, it will return a list of matrices.}

\item{alpha}{A matrix of transition probabilities}

\item{se}{A matrix of standard errors}

\item{seed}{An integer which will be used to set the seed for this draw.}
}
\value{
A transition matrix. If n>1, it will return a list of matrices.
}
