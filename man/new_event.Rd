\title{Generate new events to be added to existing vector of events}
\usage{
new_event(evt)
}
\arguments{
\item{evt}{Event name and event time}
}
\value{
No return value, adds event to \code{cur_evtlist} and integrates it with the main list for storage
}
\description{
Generate new events to be added to existing vector of events
}
\details{
The functions to add/modify events/inputs use lists. Whenever several inputs/events are added or modified, it's recommended to group them within one function, as it reduces the computation cost.
So rather than use two \code{new_event} with a list of one element, it's better to group them into a single \code{new_event} with a list of two elements.

This function is intended to be used only within the \code{add_reactevt} function in its \code{input} parameter and should not be run elsewhere or it will return an error.
}
\examples{
add_reactevt(name_evt = "idfs",input = {new_event(list("ae"=5))})
}
